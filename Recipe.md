1. Take a pan and put it on the stove
2. Take a huge bowl 
3. Put the Flour; a bit of baking soda and baking powder; a bit of vanilla essence; put a medium ampunt of sugar, ,not too much and not too less.
4. Now add the milk and mix the batter up.
5. Now you can start the stove and put some batter on and you can start making the pancakes.
6. You have to flip them when you start to see bubbles on pancakes.
8. After some time, take them out and and put them on a dish.Now you can decorate them with toppings and syrups and you can choose however you want it. I personally like it with maple syrup or with chocolate syrup and strawberries.
9. Now they are done, eat and enjoy.
